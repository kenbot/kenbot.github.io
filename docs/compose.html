    <div class="introduction">
      <p>I helped run the C◦mp◦se :: Melbourne functional programming conference in its four-year 
      run from 2016-2019, with Lyndon Maydwell, Noon Silk, Les Kitchen, Andy Kitchen, Javier 
      Candeira, Sasha Boyd, Sharon Holliday, Tushar Pokle, Sarah Oakes, Gala Camacho Ferrari 
      and Bernie Pope. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our aim was to make a friendly, laid-back community conference with talks, workshops 
        and freewheeling "unconference" sessions, accessible to beginners and aficionados alike
        from all kinds of backgrounds. We had significant assistance from the New York Compose::Conference, 
        who lent us their brand and website, YOW Australia and Dave Thomas for advice and infrastructure, and 
        RMIT University, who provided the venue.
      <p> C◦mp◦se :: Melbourne had 150-250 people in each year from all over Australia, and fantastic local and 
        international speakers and talks. We had a great time, made lots of friends, learnt a lot 
        and got really really burnt out. 
      </p>
      <p>Please enjoy the talk videos!
