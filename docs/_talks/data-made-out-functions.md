Church Encoding is a fascinating technique whereby numbers, data structures, and just about anything can be built out of nothing but functions.

Here we introduce Church Encoding and show how it can make numbers and data types materialise out of thin air.

Even better, weâ€™ll show how Church Encoding is not only a neat party trick, but occasionally useful in real code, using examples in Haskell and Java.
