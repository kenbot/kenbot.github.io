Judging by the maelstrom of complicated frameworks, articles, books, and reams of code, Dependency Injection must be one of the hardest problems faced by mankind. Or is it? Ken will argue that the problem to be solved is nowhere as scary as we have convinced ourselves and that DI frameworks like Spring, Guice, and Dagger2 are not just unnecessary, but have a tendency to harm both our code and our way of thinking. Shots fired! Along the way, we'll talk about responsibility, boundaries, modularity, testing, and maybe just a teeny smidgin of maths. Whether you are convinced or not, the arguments will be supported by detailed examples, and audience interaction/questions/heckling will be encouraged at every point!
