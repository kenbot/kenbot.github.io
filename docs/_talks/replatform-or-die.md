In 2020, MYOB’s web users saw a major upgrade and a notable increase in stability and rate of feature delivery. What they didn’t see was a behind-the-scenes existential crisis of accumulated tech debt that led to a vast replatform with a hard deadline, racing against the clock to get the company back in the game.

This is the story of how they had to rethink everything about how they planned, structured, wrote, and delivered software; how the architecture, software, teams, systems of work, and org structure had to fit together as a whole; hard lessons learnt under pressure at scale; and how it catapulted the company forward from there.
