    Please don’t use mocks or stubs in tests.  While they are seemingly ubiquitous in 
    enterprise development, they have serious drawbacks, and typically mask easily 
    fixable deficiencies in the underlying code.

    “Getting Shit Done” is the catchphrase on everybody’s lips, and 
    deservedly so!  When we deliver new functionality, our users regroup 
    and flock to us, our customers grudgingly respect us, and our shareholders 
    rejoice.  When the novel concepts invented by our product managers take 
    shape as they watch, their eyes light up with pride and enthusiasm.

    Over the last few years of maintaining code old and new at REA, it has become 
    abundantly clear that the neglect and misuse of type-systems has had a sharply 
    negative impact on our codebases. Here we address the concrete causes and 
    consequences, and propose concrete and achievable solutions.

    “I’m not good enough” says the graduate to herself, shuffling her feet.  
    “All those uni assignments made no difference; everyone knows more than me.  
    Why would anyone want to listen to what I have to say?”  Surrounded by self-assured, battle-hardened 
    colleagues, there seems an insurmountable distance to cover—but one day, she’ll surely know enough.

    A few months ago, my colleague Chris Myers and I used some 
    basic category theory concepts to guide us to a design that 
    elegantly solved a problem in a Java codebase.

    There’s a pattern that I keep recommending to teams over and over again, 
    because it helps separate concerns around I/O; sending and receiving things over a network, 
    interacting with AWS, saving and loading things from data stores. It’s an old idea; 
    you’ll find it filed under “Decorator” in your Gang of Four book.
