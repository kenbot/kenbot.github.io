Empirical evidence is very valuable, and underrated

BUT! Overused as an argument

It's not enough! We need to make judgments about the vast empirical deserts between the few oases of of reproducible studies

The fundamental reason is that it is really hard to isolate variables

Examples of good studies:
- Google study 
- DORA metrics
- TDD?

In practice almost nobody uses empirical evidence for any part of software development

Examples of accepted practice without empirical evidence:
- Don't Repeat Yourself

There's two main sources of evidence for most things: 
- Experience
- Reasoning
